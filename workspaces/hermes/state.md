# Hermes workspace state

## Current focus

Package ATHENA-authored Slice 11 draft after VULCAN and KOIOS no-blocker reviews under current meta-harness framework.

## Current validated state

- Hermes normative-language guardrail tightening was committed as `4fba6224 Tighten Hermes guardrails with normative language`.
- Workflow queue reconciliation was committed as `c0c6e482 Reconcile workflow queue with ADR successor next action`.
- HERMES-owned activation/routing for Slice 11 was committed as `7b7828ba Activate ADR successor slice for Athena handoff`.
- USER clarified that `go` means proceed with the recommended action within the meta-harness framework.
- HERMES asked ATHENA and KOIOS whether invalid reflog/Archon draft copies should be used. Both advised treating them as non-authoritative only and reconstructing fresh from current accepted surfaces.
- USER said `proceed`.
- HERMES routed active Slice 11 to the existing ATHENA session via intercom, without Archon.
- ATHENA authored/reconstructed fresh:
  - `docs/adr/adr.adr-template-schema-contract.draft.md`
- ATHENA reported validation:
  - `git status --short -- docs/adr docs/schemas dev/adr-json-authority-corpus-dry-run-inventory-slice-4` shows only the new draft.
  - `git diff --check` passed.
- HERMES independently reran the same checks with the same result.
- VULCAN returned implementation-reality review for the ATHENA draft:
  - Verdict: implementation-feasible / no blocking implementation objection.
  - Blockers: none from implementation reality.
  - Watchpoints: legacy parser compatibility for immediate machine ingest, future ingest contract selection, separate source-disposition decision for `docs/adr/adr.adr-template-contract.md`, and preserving `metadata.record_id` / `dcn` distinction.
  - HERMES treats this as implementation review input, not architecture or acceptance authority.
- KOIOS returned provenance review for the ATHENA draft:
  - Verdict: provenance-adequate for HERMES/USER review / no blocking provenance issues found.
  - Blockers: none from provenance perspective.
  - Watchpoints: explicit later relation decision for `docs/adr/adr.adr-template-contract.md`, confirm draft-internal proposed resolutions only become authority if/when accepted, keep invalid HERMES reflog and Archon/Codex drafts non-authoritative, and rerun closeout checks before packaging.
  - HERMES treats this as provenance review input, not architecture or acceptance authority.
- HERMES created draft-only packaging decision:
  - `docs/reviews/hermes-decision.20260711.181920_adr-template-schema-contract-successor-draft-slice-11.md`

## Current coherent state

Current uncommitted work:

```text
docs/adr/adr.adr-template-schema-contract.draft.md
docs/reviews/hermes-decision.20260711.181920_adr-template-schema-contract-successor-draft-slice-11.md
workspaces/hermes/state.md
workspaces/hermes/active.md
```

The workflow fixtures remain committed with active slice `adr-template-schema-contract-successor-draft-slice-11`.

## Active boundaries

The ATHENA draft is a draft only. It does not edit `docs/adr/adr.adr-template-contract.md`, edit `docs/schemas/`, change source status or casing, supersede the old source, accept/activate a new ADR, migrate records, replace generated projections, create database/storage authority, or cut over JSON authority.

## Current blockers

- No packaging blocker remains; later USER/HERMES decision is required for acceptance, revision, discard, or source-disposition handling.

## Next owner

HERMES_USER for later lifecycle/source-disposition decision after this draft-only package is committed.
